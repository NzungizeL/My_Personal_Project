1. Sequential inflammatory processes define human progression from M. tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease
(Submitter supplied) To define mechanisms that underlie progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection to active tuberculosis (TB), we followed M.tb-infected adolescents longitudinally. Those who ultimately developed TB disease (“progressors”) were compared with matched controls, who remained healthy. Whole blood transcriptomic and plasma proteome analyses showed sequential modulation of immunological processes: type I/II interferon signalling and complement cascade were elevated 18 months before TB diagnosis, while changes in myeloid inflammation and lymphoid cell, monocyte and neutrophil gene modules occurred more proximally to TB disease. more...

2. An integrated approach combining RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and Proteomics identifies the coding potential of Mycobacterium abscessus
(Submitter supplied) The objective of this study is to develop an integrated map for the M. abscessus ATCC19977 organism. Among the data types contributing to the development of this map are next-generation RNA-sequencing, differential RNA-sequencing, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry.

4. Profiling proteome-scale antibody responses to M. tuberculosis proteins in TB suspect's sera
(Submitter supplied) Human infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in a continuum of ill-defined, clinical manifestations with stable latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and severe active disease at the ends.  Identifying different states of infection is of importance to tuberculosis (TB) control since risk of developing active disease varies among different asymptomatic states while infectiousness varies among patients with different bacterial burden. more...

6. Profiling antibody responses to M. tuberculosis proteins in TB suspects’ sera using full-proteome microarrays.
(Submitter supplied) Understanding the immune response to tuberculosis requires greater knowledge of humoral responses.  To characterize antibody targets and the effect of disease parameters on target recognition, we developed a systems immunology approach that integrated detection of antibodies against the entire Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome, bacterial metabolic and regulatory pathway information, and patient data. more...

7. M. tuberculosis-M. bovis transcriptional comparison
(Submitter supplied) We used microarray hybridization to compare the total in vitro transcriptome of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Our aim was to get a global view on the differences of gene expression between these pathogens as a mean to identify the genetic basis for their distinct phenotypes.Differential expression was detected in 258 genes, representing a 6% of the total genome. Of these, 13 genes were further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. more...
